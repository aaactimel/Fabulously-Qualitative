## Q&A
**Q:** **Does it compatible with shaders?**  
**A:** **Yes!** Just install shaders you want ([Complementary Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) + Euphoria patches **preinstalled**) and play without much FPS drop!  

**Q:** **Is there any bugs or errors?**  
**A:** **Should not be**, but if it happens, please report it to [issues](https://github.com/aaactimel/Fabulously-Qualitative/issues).

**Q:** **Is it multiplayer friendly?**  
**A:** **Yes**! This modpack can even be used on official multiplayer servers without problems!

**Q:** **Does it compatible with Steam Deck, Lenovo Legion, ASUS ROG ALLY, MSI Claw?**  
**A:** Practically **yes**, but you need to install [**MidnightControls (1.9.4)**](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightcontrols/version/1.9.4+1.20) (not included to modpack because of possible bloating). FPS will be stable; however, lock to 60FPS@1080p recommended (30FPS@720p/1080p for battery saving)
